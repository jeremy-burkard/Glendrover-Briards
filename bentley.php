			As you can see from Bent's picture, he is very impressive and quite beautiful.  He is very "true to type" and at the start of his show career at just a year old, 
			he blew everyone away.  Bentley finished his AKC championship in just 3 months with very limited showing.  The weekend he finished right here in Maine, he not 
			only took best of breed both Saturday and Sunday, but also took a herding group 4 each of those days.  Of course, he had an outstanding handler, Beth Oneppo, 
			who showed him to the very best of her ability.

			Imagine our surprise when an engraved invitation arrived at our house from Eukanuba a few months later.  Only the top 20 dogs in each breed were sent 
			invitations and that included Bentley!  That was the last year Eukanuba sent out invitations and we felt honored to have been chosen to participate.  
			Unfortunately, since this show was in California, we could not attend, but just to have made the invitation list with such a young dog that attended 
			so few shows was such a gift.

			Bentley has been such an amazing accomplishment from all these years of breeding and showing, he will always hold a special place in my heart.  
			Bentley still blows people away with his accepting attitude of all he meets, and his appearance is so impressive that the "quiet" time I spend sipping tea with 
			friends at the oceanside in the small town of Belfast during our Briard get togethers each month are usually spent answering all sorts of questions, with 
			Bentley receiving more than his share of hugs for the day.  It is a pleasure to include Bentley in my day's activities.
